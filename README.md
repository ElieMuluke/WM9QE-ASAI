## Module Overview

This module aims to equip students with advanced statistical knowledge and skills to analyse, model, and solve problems in diverse real-life systems, in particular Artificial Intelligence scenarios. By developing proficiency in creating and applying statistical models effectively in problem-solving and decision-making contexts, students gain a profound understanding of the applicability of different statistical techniques to common problems and best practices for AI. The module strives to expand basic tools, enabling students to navigate complexities within data analytics.
Through a blend of theory and practice, students learn to:

* Collaboratively apply statistical tools and methods tailored to specific scenarios, present robust statistical solutions, identify and address challenges and provide insightful recommendations for decision making.
* Evaluate the assumptions and assess the appropriateness of different statistical models for diverse scenarios, incorporating AI techniques to enhance model selection and performance evaluation.
* Apply advanced statistical tools and techniques to solve problems in real-world systems.
* Critically interpret the quantitative data analysis results, present them in a meaningful way for decision making and provide practical recommendations.
* Demonstrate advanced practical skills in implementing statistical analyses using applicable software packages and AI-driven tools to automate data processing and analysis, and illustrate the outcomes through clear visualisations.
